      The task: Refactor this function.

      With this task, we want to understand your solution, so: the code changes you made and why you made them, identification of any issues or underperformance of the original function, and code comments to provide valuable insight for other developers.

      In production, the function:
       - Takes two arrays and returns a new array of unique values from both arrays
       - It is a shared utility, and is called very frequently in clientside code

      The quality of the code should:
       - Conform to ES6
       - Be performant
       - Be understandable
       - Include appropriate comments.

      Issues:
        Poor naming conventions
        Use of var instead of let or const
        Array index variables are not readable
        Keeps checking the entire first array even after a dupe has been found
        The equality test fails when comparing objects

      The main drawback of the following approach is that it still fails when the arrays contains objects. 
      includes() does not check if an object is a deep copy of another.
      However I have still included this solution because it is faster and easier to read as long as none of the array items are objects.
      I also avoided mutating the original inputs.

      This takes a similar approach but uses the lodash isEqual function.
      This allows for object comparison.
      It uses a "for of" statement to avoid array indices and improve readability 
      The if statement returns early if a match is found, improving performance.
      The lodash library is a significant dependency, but this could be optimised in production.
